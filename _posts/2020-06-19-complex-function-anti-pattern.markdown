# Introduction
You're writing a function. When should you break the function up?
Is this function too long? Who cares? This may be a little bit of a subjective
topic, but in my junior opinion, a reasonable and historical guidepost
is the [Linux kernel style guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#functions).

## The Details
### 1. One single purpose
A function should do only one thing, and do it well. Here's an example of
a function with more than one purpose.
```

```


### 2. 24 line maximum function length
### 3. Maximum indent level of 3
