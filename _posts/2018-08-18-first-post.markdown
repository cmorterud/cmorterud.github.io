<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

{% highlight python %}
def say_hello():
    print("Hello everybody!")

say_hello()
#=> prints 'Hello everybody!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Welcome to my blog! I hope you can find something useful here. 
I am just starting out a blog to connect with other people
and hopefully give back to the internet community just
as they have given to me.

I just finished an internship at Quicken Loans where I met
many wonderful people. Some people that I met already
had blogs with lots of posts, so I was interested in starting my own.
So here I am.

Cheers!
