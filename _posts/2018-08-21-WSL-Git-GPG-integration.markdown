<!-- Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

Over the course of 3 years studying Computer Science, I have made
heavy use of Bash and Git. Just last semester, I took a course called
Introduction to Cryptography where I learned about secure systems,
cryptographic schemes, authentication, abstract algebra, and more.
I was introduced to GnuPG as a program that abstracts away all
but the most essential details of encryption, and I was very impressed
with the capabilities and power that GnuPG provides to the user.

Let's say you are interested in signing your Git commits. There is much
more that can be signed, but signing Git commits can be automated once
set up, and offers some additional assurance to others that you, yourself
are the author of some commits.

I will start off by making sure GPG and Git
are installed on Bash for Ubuntu WSL.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install gnupg --yes
$ sudo apt-get install git --yes
# --yes is to automatically insert yes at prompts
{% endhighlight %}

For sanity's sake, I will print out the version of gpg and bash that I am using
{% highlight bash %}
$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.20
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
{% endhighlight %}


To generate a key, type

{% highlight bash %}
$ gpg --gen-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection?
{% endhighlight %}

I select 1 for RSA, because it's my favorite and I have implemented
it before.

{% highlight bash %}
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048)
{% endhighlight %}

I select 4096 bits for the maximum amount possible of security, at the
cost of added time to decrpyt and encrypt, although 2048 bits is
still perfectly valid on 8/21/2018.

{% highlight bash %}
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
{% endhighlight %}

I hit enter to select "key does not expire," although, one could
choose to have the key become invalid (untrusted) in a certain amount of time.
If you choose to have the key expire in a certain amount of time,
then you will need to tell git about the new key when used to  automatically
sign
commits and/or tags, which we will talk about later in this post.

{% highlight bash %}
You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: Jane Smith
Email address: JaneSmith@example.com
Comment: Example key
{% endhighlight %}

You will next fill in your real name, email address, and an optional comment.

The next prompt will be for a passphrase AKA a password to access the key.
Keep in mind that if your key falls into the wrong hands, the passphrase
is the only defense against impersonation, but if you have a passphrase,
you will need to type it in at each commit if you automatically sign commits.
I didn't make a passphrase because I trust that my computer is secure,
and that no one else is able to access it.

{% highlight bash %}
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

You do not want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".
{% endhighlight %}

Next, GPG will generate pseudo-random bytes to generate a
pair of keys.

{% highlight bash %}
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

........+++++
...........f+++++
gpg: key 1234ABCD marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.
{% endhighlight %}

Boom! You now have generated a pair of keys that can authenticate
yourself to others, as well as encrypt communications that are sent to you.

{% highlight bash %}
# show your public keyring (contains public keys)
$ gpg --list-keys
pub   4096R/1234ABCD 2018-08-21
uid                  Jane Smith (Example key) <JaneSmith@example.com>
sub   4096R/QWERTYUI 2018-08-21
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you have a public and private key, you can sign commits. To sign
commits, you will need to specify the key you are using, as well
as to automatically sign commits as they are made.

{% highlight bash %}
# set this key as your global signing key (use for all repositories)
$ git config --global user.signingkey 1234ABCD
# tell Git to attempt to sign your commits automatically (for all repositories)
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
{% endhighlight %}

Next time you make a commit, Git will try to sign the commit, and will
tell if you if there was an issue with signing the commit.

You might be interested in hosting your projects on Github, so there
is a way to get that niced "Verified" checkmark next to your commits,
and that is by telling Github what your public key is, so Github
can verify the signature on your commits.

You can do this by heading over to https://github.com/settings/profile and
clicking on SSH and GPG keys. There, you can click on "add GPG key,"
and there will be a box to paste the ASCII representation of your public key.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gpg --export --armor 1234ABCD

You need to paste that huge chunk of text into the textbox given on
Github, and then if everything works out, you can start
signing commits and getting the nice looking "Verified" stamps
in your commit history.
