## Introduction
Consider an unfair coin, with some probability $$p$$ of heads,
and $$1-p$$ probability of tails. A process to identify
the parameter of the underlying distribution, or identify
the probability of heads is Expectation Maximization.

Expectation Maximization is the process of maximizing
the likelihood of the observed data with respect
to the chosen model by tuning the parameter of the model.
A simple, intuitive example of this is 
identifying the bias of an unfair coin.

The graph shows the likelihood of $$f(p)={20\choose15}(p)^{15}(1-p)^5$$ for $$[0.0, 1.0]$$
maximizing at 0.75. Thus, 0.75 maximizes the likelihood of the observations.
This is an intuitive result, yet demonstrates the idea of likelihood maximization.
